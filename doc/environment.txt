#Environment Install

1. Copy php_ffmpeg.dll to xampp\php\ext.
2. Copy ffmpeg.exe into root of your site or anywhere else as long you know where (you will have to define path to it in your php file)...
3. Copy everything(avcodec.dll, avformat.dll) else to windows/system32.
4. Add "extension=php_ffmpeg.dll" or remove ";" on the beginning of that line in php.ini file (xampp\php\php.ini )
5. Restart apache server... and voila :)
